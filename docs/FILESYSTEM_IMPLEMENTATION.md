## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation Details**

### Backend Services

```typescript
// services/idea-filesystem.service.ts
class IdeaFilesystemService {
  async createRepository(ideaId: string): Promise<void>;
  async getFileContent(ideaId: string, filePath: string): Promise<string>;
  async updateFile(ideaId: string, filePath: string, content: string): Promise<void>;
  async deleteFile(ideaId: string, filePath: string): Promise<void>;
  async listFiles(ideaId: string): Promise<FileTreeNode[]>;

  // Version Control Methods ✅
  async getFileHistory(ideaId: string, filePath: string): Promise<FileVersion[]>;
  async getFileVersionContent(ideaId: string, filePath: string, versionId: string): Promise<string>;
  async restoreFileVersion(ideaId: string, filePath: string, versionId: string): Promise<void>;
}
```

### API Endpoints

```bash
GET    /api/ideas/:id/files              # List all files
GET    /api/ideas/:id/files/*            # Get file content
PUT    /api/ideas/:id/files/*            # Update file content
POST   /api/ideas/:id/files              # Create new file
DELETE /api/ideas/:id/files/*            # Delete file
POST   /api/ideas/:id/files/upload       # Upload binary files

# Version Control Endpoints ✅
GET    /api/ideas/:id/files/*/versions   # Get file version history
GET    /api/ideas/:id/files/*/versions/:versionId # Get specific version content
POST   /api/ideas/:id/files/*/restore    # Restore file to previous version
