- [ ] let suppose for a moment that a person comes up with an idea lets say related to biomed then he posted it on our platform and people started collaborating on it, someone in a stage goot that we need a simulation too for this so he added that, and similarly various things like docs, images, videos, research papers, survey, survey results, data visualizations and all with versioning too, and the maintainers of the repo will definitely try to structure the repositories but till how much extent they will be lost with folder inside folder inside folder nad it will be difficult for new comers to understand this much complexity of the project then how we as a platform implement a solution for this problem how are we going to address this clutter issue

  - [[Backlinking]]
- [ ] and there is one more challene in front of us let suppose we have a new comer to a project, obviously the ones working on the project for a long time will know far mmore than him, so even to contribute a little does he have to knwo about the whole project from start to end, because that will be a hinder for new comers but i understand that for quality content inputs they should ideally be floowing the repo and know a decent amount of it but still are there any sort of ideas around this
- [ ] How will we tackle the problem of the ownership of ideas how will we convince the users that while they are posting their ideas here it belongs to them without an idea patent and is it even necessary to have an idea patent or our platform time stamps are enoough if it is the case then if any company peeks into the idea and claims that we were already working on this idea while they were not then how will we solve this.
  - [ ] The one solution for this that i got is verifying each user in the platform with their official ids before being able to view or contribute to confidential and non completely open ideas but i dot think it is a good solution for the problem
