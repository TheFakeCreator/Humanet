# üåê Project Brief: **Humanet** (Working Title)

_"The Network of Human Ideas"_

---

## üîπ **Core Vision**

A platform to **capture, organize, and grow human ideas into actionable projects**. Unlike GitHub, which is focused on code repositories, Humanet is focused on **ideas as the first-class citizens**. It gives structure to ideas, enables collaboration across domains, and ensures every contributor‚Äîwhether they code, research, design, or just suggest‚Äîis attributed fairly.

---

## üîπ **Problem Statement**

- People have **great ideas** but often can‚Äôt pursue them due to lack of domain expertise, time, or resources.
- Ideas get **lost in personal notes, chats, or social media** and rarely evolve into actionable projects.
- Existing platforms (like GitHub, Behance, Reddit, Notion) either focus on a **single format (code, art, posts, docs)** or are **not structured for discovery & collaboration of raw ideas**.
- No single platform **tracks the evolution of an idea** into different versions, forks, or collaborations across multiple disciplines.

---

## üîπ **Solution**

**Humanet** = **GitHub for Ideas + LinkedIn for Domain Matching + Notion for Documentation + Family Tree for Evolution**

- Every idea lives as a structured **repository** with required docs (`idea.md`, `scope.md`, `search.md`, etc.).
- Ideas can **evolve, fork, or merge**, forming a **family tree of ideas** (USP).
- Contributors from relevant **domains get notified** about new ideas and can collaborate.
- AI + search improves discoverability and helps connect related ideas.
- Users earn **karma/reputation points** for contributing, sharing, or refining ideas.

---

## üîπ **Key Features**

### 1. **Idea Repositories**

- Each idea is a repo (like GitHub, but for ideas).
- Standard `.humanet` folder with docs:
  - `idea.md` ‚Üí main description.
  - `scope.md` ‚Üí scope of work.
  - `problem.md` ‚Üí what problem it solves.
  - `search.md` ‚Üí keywords, tags, auto-updated with AI & user searches.
- Attachments allowed: sketches, flowcharts, references, datasets.

---

### 2. **Idea Evolution (Family Tree)**

- Ideas can be:
  - **Forked** ‚Üí to create a variant.
  - **Merged** ‚Üí when two ideas combine.
  - **Extended** ‚Üí when someone adds a new layer (feature, research angle, etc.).
- A **visual tree** shows the journey from seed idea ‚Üí multiple versions ‚Üí real projects.

---

### 3. **Collaboration & Domain Matching**

- When an idea is posted, people with matching **skills/domains** get notified.
- Contributors can:
  - Add research.
  - Build prototypes.
  - Suggest improvements.
  - Just validate the idea with feedback.

---

### 4. **Open Ideas Pool**

- Users can submit **‚Äúopen ideas‚Äù** they can‚Äôt work on.
- Others can **pick them up** and start working while keeping attribution.
- Creates a **shared pool of innovation**.

---

### 5. **Karma & Reputation System**

- Points for:
  - Posting ideas.
  - Adding meaningful docs.
  - Helping others refine ideas.
  - Collaborations that lead to successful prototypes/projects.
- Leaderboards ‚Üí motivate engagement.
- Reputation can later tie into **jobs, collaborations, or even funding opportunities**.

---

### 6. **Search & Discovery (AI-powered)**

- `search.md` evolves with interactions ‚Üí better discovery.
- AI suggests:
  - Related ideas.
  - Domain experts to contact.
  - Research papers or projects that align.
- Personalized feeds based on user interests.

---

### 7. **Monetization & Sustainability**

- **Free tier** ‚Üí open contribution.
- **Pro tier** (for monetization):
  - Private idea repositories.
  - Advanced analytics on idea growth.
  - Team spaces for startups/companies.
  - AI-powered insights for research & market fit.
- Possible **funding/partnerships**: connect ideas with investors, accelerators, or grant bodies.

## üîπ **Differentiation from GitHub & Others**

| Feature                | GitHub                   | Notion | LinkedIn                | Humanet                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ | ------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Focus**              | Code                     | Notes  | Professional networking | Ideas & Innovation        |
| **First-class entity** | Repo (code)              | Page   | Profile                 | Repo (idea)               |
| **Evolution Tracking** | Code commits             | None   | Career growth           | Idea family tree          |
| **Domain Matching**    | None                     | None   | Job matching            | Expert matching for ideas |
| **Open Ideas Pool**    | No                       | No     | No                      | Yes                       |
| **Search Evolution**   | Static keywords          | Manual | Static                  | AI + interaction-based    |
| **Karma/Reputation**   | Indirect (contributions) | No     | Connections             | Points, recognition       |

## üîπ **Future Roadmap**

1. **Phase 1 (MVP)** ‚Üí Idea repos + docs + search + karma.
2. **Phase 2** ‚Üí Domain matching + family tree visualization + notifications.
3. **Phase 3** ‚Üí AI features + monetization tier + investor/startup integrations.
4. **Phase 4** ‚Üí Global community + hackathons + integration with GitHub, arXiv, etc.

‚úÖ In short: **Humanet = the missing layer before GitHub, where raw ideas are born, evolve, and find the right people to make them real.**
