## Technical Architecture Priorities

### File System Implementation Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Simple file metadata in MongoDB
2. **Phase 2**: Basic file storage with hash references
3. **Phase 2.5**: Full Git-inspired architecture with:
   - Content blobs (hash-addressed storage)
   - Tree structures (directory organization)
   - Commit history (version control)
   - Branch management (parallel development)

### Performance & Scalability
- [ ] Database sharding and replication
- [ ] Microservices architecture
- [ ] Event-driven architecture
- [ ] GraphQL API implementation
- [ ] Edge computing deployment
- [ ] Advanced caching strategies

### Security & Compliance
- [ ] End-to-end encryption for sensitive files
- [ ] Role-based access control (RBAC)
- [ ] Audit logging and compliance
- [ ] Data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA)
- [ ] Security penetration testing
- [ ] Bug bounty program
